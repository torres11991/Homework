    "\n",

    "NumPy is faster which allows for more conveniency in its utility. NumPy also uses less memory space than Python list may. \n",
    "\n",
    "12. When creating an \"empty\" array, where do the elements come from?\n",
    "An element within an array are either derived from another module or created by the user. The compilation of elements within an array are all of the same type such as strings, integers, or floats. \n"
